            <h2> Introduction </h2>
            <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is automatic manipulation of natural languages such as speech and text
                by
                software.
                Some of the more recent projects in NLP are sentimental analysis and text mining. Sentimental analysis
                and
                text
                mining are two of the most popular techniques used in tracking opinions and attitudes on the web and
                using
                it to
                determine whether it has positive or negative effect on the public. </p>

            <p>Text data is different from most of the other forms of raw data. It is extremely high dimensional. Most
                of
                the text
                sentences people use in reviews are short and sometimes grammatically incorrect. Most of these sentences
                are
                full of
                slangs and often ambiguous. People use these short sentences with slangs to express their opinion and
                sentiments.</p>

            <h2> Sentimental Analysis </h2>
            <p>Sentimental Analysis (SA), according to Wikipedia, is the use of natural language processing, text
                analysis,
                computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study
                affective
                states
                and subjective information. That is, sentimental analysis can be viewed as the process of detecting
                whether
                a piece
                of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. Some of the questions we can use SA to answer are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Is the review of a particular product positive or negative</li>
                <li>Does this customer like our brand?</li>
                <li>What is the general attitude of this speaker</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Calculating Average Sentiment Scores</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Let p<sub>i</sub> be each document or paragraph such that $p_{i}=\left\{
                    s_{1},s_{2},\cdots,s_{n}\right\} $
                    where
                    s<sub>j</sub> are the sentences within each document.
                </li>

                <li> Each document is broken down into element of sentences: s<sub>ij</sub> =$\left\{
                    w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}\right\} $,
                    where w<sub>k</sub> are the words within each sentence.
                </li>

                <li> Let w<sub>ijk</sub> represent the words where $i$ is the $ith$ document or paragraph, $j$ is the
                    $jth$
                    sentence, and $k$ is the $kth$ word. Example w<sub>234</sub> is read as the fourth word from the
                    third
                    sentence
                    of the second document.
                </li>

                <li> The words in each sentence w<sub>ijk</sub> are searched and compared to a dictionary of polarized
                    words
                    (syuzhet package and lexicon package).
                </li>

                <li> Let c<sub>ijk</sub> be a cluster of polarized words such that c<sub>ijl</sub> $\subseteq$
                    w<sub>ij</sub>. The
                    words in each polarized cluster are tagged as neutral $\left(w_{ijk}^{0}\right),$ negator
                    $\left(w_{ijk}^{n}\right),$ amplifier $\left(w_{ijk}^{a}\right),$ or de-amplifier
                    $\left(w_{ijk}^{d}\right)$.
                </li>

                <li>Each c<sub>ijl</sub> is then weighted based on the weights from the dictionary of polarized words
                </li>

                <li>Each polarity (sentiment) score ($\delta$<sub>ij</sub>) for each sentence is given by
                    $\delta_{ij}=\frac{c_{ij}^{\prime}}{\sqrt{w_{ijn}}}$,
                    where $c_{ij}^{\prime}$ is the sum of the weighted $c_{ijl}$, and $w_{ijn}$ is the total word count
                    in
                    each
                    sentence within each document.
                </li>

                <li>Average sentiment score of all the sentences within a document is then given by
                    $\zeta_{ij}=\frac{1}{n}\sum\delta_{ij}$ where $n$ is the number of sentences in each document.
                </li>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The aim of this short project is to look at the reviews of samsung wireless charger from amazon website
                with
                product
                code <em>B01BHEIIR4</em>. These reviews would be classified as either as positive or negative and then
                build
                a model
                using the classified reviews as target variable.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2> Data Description</h2>

            <p>The data for this project is a text data from amazon website. The data is a collection of the reviews of
                samsung wireless charging pad. Below is how the charging pad looks like.
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Samsung Wireless Charger</figcaption>
                </figure>

            </p>
            <p> The text data has 8918 observations or reviews with 3 important variables. These variables are title,
                comments, and
                rates(stars). There were more than 7000 different words used in the review.
                A few examples of the comments made by some of the customers are
            </p>
            <p>

                </figure>
            </p>

            <h2> Descriptive Analysis </h2>

            <h3> Frequency Terms</h3>
            <p>First, we look at the top 10 frequent terms used by the customers. We see that the word 'phone' appears
                to be
                the
                most frequent word used by the customers and this is not surprising since the wireless charger is used
                by
                the phone.
                Almost every comment (positive or negative) has 'phone' in the sentences. The next most frequent word is
                "charging".
                This "charging" could mean whether the charging system is good or bad depending on the sentences. From
                the
                top 10
                frequent words, we can see that the wireless charging pad is likely to have more positive reviews than
                negative
                reviews.</p>

            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>Word Cloud</h3>
            <p>The diagram below shows the word clouds of the top 150 frequent words used by the customers. From the
                diagram, we can
                see that most of the customers use words like <em>phone, charging, charge, works, and charger.</em>
            </p>

            <p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
            </p>
            <h3>Word Association</h3>
            <p>Based on the most frequent words, we decided to look some of the words associated with 'works' and
                'charging'. With
                the term "works", it is observed that "works" is mostly associated with "great" followed by "well". The
                correlation
                between "works" and "great" is 0.30. Looking at the "charging" term, it is mostly associated with "pad"
                with
                correlation of 0.57.</p>
            <p>

                </figure>
            </p>
            <h3>Network of Terms</h3>
            <p>The network of terms graph below shows how the various words are related. It shows multiple relationship
                among the words used by the customers. The figure also explains the strength of correlation among the
                terms
                or
                words. From the figure we can see that when a customer uses the word "charging", the next likely word to
                be
                used
                is "phone" or "works".</p>

            <h2>Performing Sentiment Analysis</h2>
            <p> Before performing sentiment analysis on the customer ratings, we take a look at the frequency table of
                the
                overall
                customer ratings. From the graph below we can see that more than 5000 customer rated the charger as
                being
                excellent. About 110 customers gave the device a-one-star rating. From the frequency graph we can see
                the
                majority
                of the customers like the device.
                <figure>

                </figure>
                Next, we take a look at the top 5 both negative and positive sentence based on polarities.
            </p>
            <div class="row">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <h3> Classifying Sentiments </h3>
            <p> Each average sentiment was classified as either positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiments with average
                score more
                than 0 were classified as positive, less than 0 were classified as negative and sentiments with
                approximately 0 were
                classified as neutral. In all, there were 6770 reviews that were classified as positive, 1537 negative,
                and
                611
                being neutral. The figure below shows the average sentiment score and their classifications for the
                first 10
                customers. The frequency distribution of the classified sentiments shows that majority of the customers
                gave
                a
                five-star.</p>

            <h2>Ordinal Logistic Model</h2>
            <p>The summary of the ordinal logistic model is shown below. The estimated coefficient of average sentiment
                score is
                4.9558 with a very low p-value suggesting the average sentiment score variable is highly significant.

            <ul>
                <li>The estimated odds of a 1 star rating vs 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 change by 0.236 times for a 4.9558
                    increase in
                    average
                    sentiment scores.
                </li>
                <li>Similarly, the estimated odds of a 2 star rating vs 1 or 3 or 4 or 5 change by 0.446 for a 4.9558
                    increase in
                    average sentiment scores.
                </li>
                <li>The same interpretation can be given to the rest of the ratings.</li>
                <li>We can see that the odds ratio increases with the number of ratings (stars).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The project seeks to analyse the customers reviews of Samsung wireless charger and to determine if the
                ratings
                (stars) correspond to the reviews using sentiment scores. Ordinal logistic model was found to be
                appropriate
                for
                this data and that was to determine the relationship between the two variables. It was found that there
                is a
                linear
                relationship between the stars and their average sentiment scores. The average sentiment scores and the
                stars are
                positively correlated. </p>
