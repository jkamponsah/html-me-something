<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p>Natural language processing (NLP) is automatic manipulation of natural languages such as speech and text by software.
    Some of the more recent projects in NLP are sentimental analysis and text mining. Sentimental analysis and text
    mining are two of the most popular techniques used in tracking opinions and attitudes on the web and using it to
    determine whether it has positive or negative effect on the public. </p>

<p>Text data is different from most of the other forms of raw data. It is extremely high dimensional. Most of the text
    sentences people use in reviews are short and sometimes grammatically incorrect. Most of these sentences are full of
    slangs and often ambiguous. People use these short sentences with slangs to express their opinion and
    sentiments.</p>

<h2> Sentimental Analysis </h2>
<p>Sentimental Analysis (SA), according to Wikipedia, is the use of natural language processing, text analysis,
    computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states
    and subjective information. That is, sentimental analysis can be viewed as the process of detecting whether a piece
    of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. Some of the questions we can use SA to answer are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Is the review of a particular product positive or negative</li>
    <li>Does this customer like our brand?</li>
    <li>What is the general attitude of this speaker</li>
</ul>

<h3>Calculating Average Sentiment Scores</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Let p<sub>i</sub> be each document or paragraph such that $p_{i}=\left\{ s_{1},s_{2},\cdots,s_{n}\right\} $
        where
        s<sub>j</sub> are the sentences within each document.
    </li>

    <li> Each document is broken down into element of sentences: s<sub>ij</sub> =$\left\{
        w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}\right\} $,
        where w<sub>k</sub> are the words within each sentence.
    </li>

    <li> Let w<sub>ijk</sub> represent the words where $i$ is the $ith$ document or paragraph, $j$ is the $jth$
        sentence, and $k$ is the $kth$ word. Example w<sub>234</sub> is read as the fourth word from the third sentence
        of the second document.
    </li>

    <li> The words in each sentence w<sub>ijk</sub> are searched and compared to a dictionary of polarized words
        (syuzhet package and lexicon package).
    </li>

    <li> Let c<sub>ijk</sub> be a cluster of polarized words such that c<sub>ijl</sub> $\subseteq$ w<sub>ij</sub>. The
        words in each polarized cluster are tagged as neutral $\left(w_{ijk}^{0}\right),$ negator
        $\left(w_{ijk}^{n}\right),$ amplifier $\left(w_{ijk}^{a}\right),$ or de-amplifier $\left(w_{ijk}^{d}\right)$.
    </li>

    <li>Each c<sub>ijl</sub> is then weighted based on the weights from the dictionary of polarized words</li>

    <li>Each polarity (sentiment) score ($\delta$<sub>ij</sub>) for each sentence is given by
        $\delta_{ij}=\frac{c_{ij}^{\prime}}{\sqrt{w_{ijn}}}$,
        where $c_{ij}^{\prime}$ is the sum of the weighted $c_{ijl}$, and $w_{ijn}$ is the total word count in each
        sentence within each document.
    </li>

    <li>Average sentiment score of all the sentences within a document is then given by
        $\zeta_{ij}=\frac{1}{n}\sum\delta_{ij}$ where $n$ is the number of sentences in each document.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3> Classifying Sentiments </h3>
<p> Each average sentiment was classified as either positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiments with average score more
    than 0 were classified as positive, less than 0 were classified as negative and sentiments with approximately 0 were
    classified as neutral. In all, there were 6770 reviews that were classified as positive, 1537 negative, and 611
    being neutral.</p>
